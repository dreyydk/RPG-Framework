# RPG Framework ⚔️

The RPG Framework is a JavaScript-based project. It is an application that contains a variety of classes created through OOP that can be useful for game developers looking for simplified logic for a turn-based combat system.

## Features 📄

The system has the following features:
- **Character Creation:** Users can create characters with different classes, such as Thief, Mage, and Warrior.
- **Character Stats:** Each character has unique stats, such as health, attack, and defense.
- **Attack Action:** So far, the only method added has been attack, which, as the name suggests, allows a character to carry out an attack on a specific target.
- **Character Classes:** The system includes different character classes, each with its own unique characteristics.

If no changes are made, the output should be this:
